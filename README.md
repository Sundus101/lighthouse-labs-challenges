21-Days Coding Challenge: Java Script
Hi, you may use my solution if you get stuck to get an idea for what to do. Don't just copy and paste to catch up to the daily challenges, 
trying it yourself will help a lot with the learning process. Though, a lot of the solutins turn out to be similar anyway. But still, 
try it yourself first. Not really sure when to use what license so didn't choose any. Best of luck! :)
